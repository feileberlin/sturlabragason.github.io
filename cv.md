## Hi I'm Sturla Bragason!

Here is a list of things I personally and professionally appreciate: Open-Source, Privacy, the Fediverse, Blockchain, and Decentralization. Here are areas in which I have extensive knowledge and expertise: Azure, AWS, DevOps, Git, Cloud Strategy, and architecting solutions involving these technologies.
