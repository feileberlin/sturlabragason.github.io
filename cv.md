## Hey there, I'm Sturla Bragason!

I'm a firm believer in open-source and the power it holds for the exchange of information. I've been working with Linux for over a decade, and my dedication to the open-source community has only intensified with time.

I'm the type of person who enjoys delving into complex issues and discovering inventive solutions. My curiosity keeps me learning and growing, continuously exploring different applications and cutting-edge technologies. I've come to realize that effective communication is just as crucial as technical expertise, and I make it a point to share my insights with others.

Outside of coding and trying out various applications, I'm committed to promoting a free and open internet, supporting initiatives such as net neutrality and degrowth. I'm convinced that technology can help bridge gaps between people and contribute to a more informed and connected society.

Feel free to explore my site and learn more about me. I'm always open for a conversation, so don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to discuss anything tech-related.

PS. If you came here looking for my CVs, here they are: [short](https://sturlabragason.github.io/cv/sturlabragason_onepager.pdf) / [long](https://sturlabragason.github.io/cv/sturlabragason.pdf).
