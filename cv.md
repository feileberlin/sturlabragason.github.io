## Hey there, I'm Sturla Bragason!

I'm a tech enthusiast with a love for everything open-source. I've been tinkering with Linux for more than a decade, and my passion for the open-source community has only grown stronger over the years.

I'm the kind of person who enjoys diving deep into problems and finding innovative solutions. My curiosity keeps me learning and evolving, always exploring new ideas and technologies. I've learned that effective communication is just as important as technical know-how, and I make it a priority to share my knowledge with others.

When I'm not coding or experimenting with new tools, I'm an advocate for a free and open internet, championing causes like net neutrality and sustainable growth. I believe in using technology to bring people together and create a better future for everyone.

Feel free to explore my site and get to know me better. I'm always up for a chat, so don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk about anything tech.

PS. If you came here looking for my CVs, here they are: [short](https://sturlabragason.github.io/cv/sturlabragason_onepager.pdf) / [long](https://sturlabragason.github.io/cv/sturlabragason.pdf).
