# Simplifying Developer Portals with a Custom Backstage Implementation on Azure

In this blog post, I will share my unique approach to simplifying developer portals using a custom Backstage implementation on Azure. This personal project leverages Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform Cloud, making it easy for organizations to deploy and tailor a Backstage application according to their requirements.

## Backstage: A Brief Introduction

Backstage is an open-source platform aimed at helping organizations create efficient developer portals. With its centralized software catalog, it brings order to microservices and infrastructure while enabling product teams to deliver high-quality code quickly and independently.

## My Custom Backstage Solution

I have created a comprehensive solution that simplifies deploying the Backstage application on Azure. By harnessing modern technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform Cloud Workspaces, organizations can rapidly adapt the platform to their specific needs.

### Essential Components and Interactions

My custom solution is structured in a modular fashion, with key components interacting seamlessly to establish a robust and scalable deployment pipeline:

1. **Terraform Bootstrap**: This module establishes the foundational resources necessary for the rest of the deployment process. It includes Terraform Cloud workspaces, variables, and service principals with scoped access.

2. **Azure Infrastructure**: The Azure module deploys vital resources like Kubernetes clusters, container registries, and storage accounts. It also manages the propagation of relevant variables to other modules.

3. **Backstage Application**: This central module houses the source code for the Backstage application. A Docker image is built and pushed to the container registry set up by the Azure module.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: The Kubernetes module deploys resources and injects required environment variables into the Backstage application, ensuring seamless operation and integration.

### Streamlined Deployment Process

My custom Backstage solution provides a simplified deployment process, making it straightforward for organizations to customize and launch their Backstage applications on Azure. By following the accompanying documentation, users can adapt the platform to their unique needs with minimal effort.

## Future Plans: Exciting Features Ahead

I am continuously working on improving this custom Backstage solution, with an ambitious roadmap of features aimed at further enhancing the platform:

- **Backstage Development Environment**: A dedicated environment for managing the platform's services and components.
- **Kubernetes Scaling**: Automatic scaling of Kubernetes pods based on usage.
- **Custom DNS and Subdomains**: A custom DNS domain name for the Backstage platform and its services.
- **Azure RBAC Best Practices**: Implementation of Role-Based Access Control to safeguard sensitive data and operations.
- **Diagnostics**: Integration of monitoring and diagnostic tools for performance and health insights.
- **Postgres Backup**: Regular backup and recovery procedures for the PostgreSQL database.
- **Service Catalog**: Showcasing available services and their usage.
- **Flexible Deployment Options**: Various deployment options to accommodate diverse customer needs.
- **Multi-tenancy**: A multi-tenant architecture for secure, simultaneous usage by multiple customers.

## In Conclusion

My custom Backstage solution is paving the way for simplified developer portals by harnessing the power of Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform Cloud. With its modular architecture and feature-rich roadmap, organizations can confidently deploy and customize Backstage to meet their evolving needs.
