## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital era, the state of media is a cause for concern. The media landscape is flooded with sensationalism, polarization, and misinformation. It's time to address the challenges and navigate through this chaos.

## The Current State of Things

In today's media landscape, we're inundated with biased narratives and enticing clickbait headlines. A significant number of outlets prioritize views and click-traffic over factual integrity. This predisposition results in a proliferation of sensationalized stories that, rather than inform, further entrench societal divisions.

This issue is further compounded by the sheer volume of information available to us. Discerning factual truth becomes a challenge when faced with a ceaseless stream of news content. The abundance and diversity of these sources, some reliable, others not, contributes to a general state of confusion.

The role of social media platforms in this scenario cannot be overlooked. By nature, they tend to amplify our existing beliefs and isolate us within digital echo chambers. This seclusion hinders our exposure to and understanding of differing viewpoints, intensifying the problem of polarization. As a result, we find ourselves caught in an endless cycle of bias confirmation, making it harder than ever to engage in objective, nuanced discussions.

## The Imperative for a New Approach

Addressing the challenges of bias, polarization, and information overload in our current media landscape necessitates a novel solution: a personalized news feed. This tool is designed to provide reliable, balanced information tailored to individual preferences.

Reliable sources are becoming harder to find in the torrent of 24/7 news, increasing the difficulty of staying accurately informed. A tailored news feed provides an antidote by offering information from diverse, trustworthy sources. This personalized tool not only aids in fostering a more informed and engaged readership but also serves as a reliable guide through the chaos of misinformation.

## Building a Solution

### Leveraging RSS Feeds

One potential remedy lies in utilizing RSS feeds. RSS stands for 'Really Simple Syndication' and has been used for decades to deliver updates from websites. It provides a personalized news wire service, allowing users to follow their favorite websites and receive updates in a chronological list.

### GitHub Pages, Python, and GitHub Actions

To overcome the challenges of device-specific setups and accessibility, we can leverage technologies like GitHub Pages, Python, and GitHub Actions. GitHub Pages allows hosting a website directly from a GitHub repository, providing accessibility across devices. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, can be used for parsing RSS feeds. GitHub Actions enables automating tasks such as fetching and updating the news feed.

### Assembling Reliable Sources

Curating a list of reliable news sources is crucial. Ad Fontes Media's Interactive Media Bias Chart provides an analysis of various news sources based on factors like reliability and bias. By examining these ratings, we can identify balanced and trusted news outlets.

### Parsing RSS Feeds

Using the `feedparser` module in Python, we can parse the RSS feeds from the chosen sources. This allows us to extract relevant news items and prepare them for the personalized news feed.

### Automation and HTML Generation

By setting up a GitHub Actions workflow, the RSS feeds can be fetched and parsed at regular intervals. The extracted news items can be injected into an HTML template using Jinja2, generating a static HTML page. This page can be committed and pushed to the GitHub Pages repository.

### Enhancing the Reading Experience

To improve the reading experience, the news feed can be styled using CSS. Applying a dark mode theme, such as the Catpuccino Mocha theme colors, creates a visually appealing interface.

## Conclusion

Crafting a personalized news feed is essential in navigating today's media landscape. By leveraging technologies and curating reliable sources, we can filter through the chaos and access accurate information tailored to our interests.

Remember, today's media environment requires vigilance and critical thinking. It's up to us to actively seek reliable sources and engage with diverse perspectives.
