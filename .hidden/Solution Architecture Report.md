RAG Technology with Azure Search OpenAI Demo

We've been approached by multiple clients interested in exploring [Retrievable Augmented Generative](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) (RAG) technology, signaling a clear demand for accessible and simple solutions. For a quick and straightforward implemention we've used the [Azure Search OpenAI Demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) (ASOD). Built using [python](https://www.python.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) and [azure developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev); it offers an easy way to set up a complete RAG solution in the client's environment in a very short time. 

We wanted to demystify RAG technology, offering enhanced search capabilities powered by OpenAI and Azure AI Search, with each implementation specifically tailored to meet the needs of our clients.

#### Our Approach

Our primary goals were the following:
- Empower clients to seamlessly interact with their data.
- Streamline deployment to Azure, ensuring all necessary services are up and running swiftly.
- Simplify the process of updating the RAG search index with new data.

> Empower clients to seamlessly interact with their data.

After deployment, ASOD provides a user-friendly web application frontend, facilitating straightforward engagement with data. This interface is designed for intuitive use, allowing users to query their data effortlessly. Responses are enriched with citations directly linked to the source documents, available as PDFs within the solution, enhancing transparency and trust in the provided information. Our customizations to ASOD included the integration of GitHub workflows and Azure DevOps pipelines. We've tailored the branding and dialogue prompts to fit each client's scenario. We also enable GPT-4V which allows the solution to engage with visual data like graphs and images. We've also created an integration with Microsoft Teams, permitting direct service queries through outgoing webhooks. This setup offers a tangible demonstration of RAG technology's benefits, making its potential immediately evident. Users can see the relevance and accuracy of search results firsthand, showcasing the power of integrating RAG into their data management and search strategies.
