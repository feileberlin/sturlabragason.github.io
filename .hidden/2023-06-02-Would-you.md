why i am not allowed to talk politics (and why my wife thinks im an idiot)


comparision = operating systems -> systems > systems of goverment

whenever somebody talks about politics i feel like they are talking about how windows works, i dont want to talk about windows works, i want to talk about how we can install and configure linux

forced subscription

absolutely amazingly inefficent

corrupt

popularity contest

shareholders have absolutley no say

the only reason it doesnt run into the ground is because of the forced subscription company cant be 

taxes - an abusive relationship

goverment has no respect for its citizens, believes itself irreplaceable and untouchable

algocracy
technocracy


# Why I Am Not Allowed to Talk Politics (And Why My Wife Thinks I'm an Idiot)

Consider the analogy of operating systems: the difference between discussing the inner workings of a proprietary system versus the exciting prospect of installing and configuring a versatile, community-driven system. 

## The Current System: A Forced Subscription

Our current governmental structure is a forced subscription service, inefficient to the point of absurdity. An institution that should be driving progress is instead riddled with corruption and stasis. It functions like a popularity contest where the voice of the many overshadows the needs of the few. The shareholders in this system, the citizens, are left unheard and unserved.

This system, if run as any other company, would face bankruptcy. Yet, it perseveres, supported by the very individuals it disappoints, through a taxation system that closely resembles an abusive relationship.

## Taxes: The Abusive Relationship We're All In

Our tax system is akin to an abusive partner who demands more while offering less. The government behaves as though it is irreplaceable, untouchable, and unaccountable to its citizens.

## A Vision for a Better System: Algocracy and Technocracy

This is where the notions of algocracy and technocracy become intriguing. An algocracy is a system of governance based on algorithmic rules, not human decision-making. A technocracy, meanwhile, assigns leadership roles based on expertise rather than popularity or political alliances.

We should aspire to create a society embodying these principles, where algorithms, not whims, inform decision-making, and expertise, not popularity, leads to leadership roles.


In summary, I am not interested in conventional politics, just as I am not interested in discussing the specifics of proprietary operating systems. I am interested in radical change, in envisioning and creating a society for the people, by the people. This radical viewpoint is why I am often disallowed from discussing politics at the dinner table, and why my wife thinks I'm an idiot. But I am a firm believer that these "idiotic" ideas are the ones that possess the power to transform our society and world for the better.
