# An Approach to Sustainable Decentralized Autonomous Communities

## Setting the Scene

A clear understanding of the socio-economic systems currently in place serves as the foundation for our endeavor. We scrutinize their flaws and limitations as a means to guide the formulation of a more equitable and sustainable alternative. Drawing from this understanding, we put forward a vision for a new type of socio-economic system - sustainable, decentralized autonomous communities (DACs) – governed through blockchain technology.

DACs are a bold vision for a network of small towns or communities, each powered by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). Through smart contracts, each town would have its own mini-economy, where people trade goods and services with each other in a fair and transparent manner. The idea is to use technology to foster a local, sustainable, and equitable economy while allowing for global connectivity and collaboration.  

## Guiding Principles

The underlying principles guiding our approach are derived from ancient wisdom but reframed for modern times. Our system has a flexible and adaptable nature that allows it to evolve in response to changing socio-economic climates, technology, and human needs. Each aspect of the system has been meticulously planned and designed to create an ecosystem that is not only self-sustaining but also improves the quality of life for all its inhabitants.

## Technological Infrastructure

We leverage existing technologies and resources to our advantage. The Metaverse serves as a digital extension of these towns, allowing residents to work and collaborate globally. AI and Robotics, the workhorses of the future, handle much of the manual labor and administrative tasks, freeing humans for creative, strategic, or interpersonal tasks. High-speed internet, AR/VR equipment in co-working spaces, allow for global collaboration. The focus is on utilizing the terrain of the modern world to the community’s advantage.

## Winning Public Support

Crafting a compelling narrative around the proposed system is critical to winning public support. By painting a vision of sustainable, equitable, and high-tech communities, we aim to make the concept attractive and desirable for a broad range of people, from technologists and policymakers to the general public.

## Ethical Leadership

In the decentralized governance structure of the DACs, it's crucial to foster ethical leadership and promote fairness, equity, and transparency. These form the moral backbone of the community, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of all community members.

## Step by Step Process

Given the scale of this endeavor, a strategic phased approach is recommended:

I want to write a blogpost outlining my proposal for a possible future 

it aims to solve several problems at once

the global housing crisis
the imminent global economic collapse
global wealth inequality
global warming

the system is composed of several interwoven modules

forts
drone boats
radionet
open

lets break down how each works starting at the outermost layer

open
an economic system based on the ability of blockchain technologies to transparanetly track contributos, contracts, ownership, work
it also functions as a currency, banking system, and salary provider all at once
a citizens work is tracked on the blockchain
systems of ownership function differently from current capitalistic systems

########################################################################3333333

















Here's a proposal for a blockchain-based socio-economic system:

## 1. Universal Basic Income (UBI)

Every citizen receives a universal basic income, enough to cover basic necessities such as food, clothing, and transportation. This would be managed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the blockchain. The UBI would be a form of digital currency that could be spent on goods and services within the economy. 

## 2. Wealth Cap

The blockchain tracks the wealth of every citizen in real-time. Once an individual reaches a predetermined wealth cap, additional income must be contributed back into the community, for example by funding public services or being redistributed to other citizens. This ensures a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources.

## 3. Tokenized Labour & Contracts

All work and contracts are managed on the blockchain, with the labor being tokenized. People are paid in digital currency for their work, and the details of their contracts are transparent and publicly available on the blockchain. This transparency prevents unfair labor practices and exploitation. 

## 4. Housing DAO

Housing is managed by another DAO, with each family given a standard unit of housing. The blockchain would record the ownership and any changes made to the property. 

Families could purchase additional units of housing or make upgrades using their digital currency. The DAO would ensure that housing is allocated fairly and that no individual or family can hoard property beyond the established cap. 

## 5. Free Education and Healthcare

Education and healthcare are also managed by DAOs and funded through the redistributed wealth. 

All transactions, from doctor appointments to course registrations, are recorded on the blockchain to ensure transparency and fairness.

## 6. Decentralized Governance 

Decisions that affect the community as a whole, such as the wealth cap and the allocation of public funds, would be made collectively by the citizens through a decentralized voting system on the blockchain. This ensures that the system is truly democratic and not controlled by a small elite.

Here's a summary of the system:

```
- UBI: Managed by a DAO on the blockchain. Every citizen receives enough digital currency to cover basic necessities.
- Wealth Cap: Wealth of every citizen is tracked in real-time. Once the cap is reached, excess wealth is redistributed.
- Tokenized Labour & Contracts: All work and contracts are transparently managed on the blockchain. Labor is tokenized and compensated with digital currency.
- Housing DAO: Each family is allocated a standard unit of housing. Additional units or upgrades can be purchased with digital currency. The DAO ensures fair allocation and prevents hoarding.
- Free Education and Healthcare: Both services are managed by DAOs and funded through the redistributed wealth. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.
- Decentralized Governance: Community decisions are made collectively through a blockchain-based voting system, ensuring a democratic system.
```


towns

In expanding this blockchain-based socio-economic system into a town-level structure, we can think of each town as an individual node within a larger, interconnected network. Each node operates independently, but all nodes follow the same underlying protocols.

## 1. Town DAO

Each town is governed by its own decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This DAO handles local governance and administration, including managing public spaces and local resources, enforcing rules and regulations, and facilitating local decision-making. The members of the DAO would be the residents of the town.

## 2. Open Source Town Design

The design of each town is based on open source blueprints which are optimized for the well-being of its inhabitants and the sustainability of the environment. These blueprints can be continuously updated and improved upon by the global community.

## 3. Self-sufficient Infrastructure

Each town is equipped with essential services like a town hall, grocery store, school, healthcare facilities etc. These services are locally managed and funded by the redistributed wealth from the citizens.

## 4. Inter-town Trade

While each town is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible, there will inevitably be certain resources or services that some towns have a surplus of while others lack. A blockchain-based system can be used to facilitate fair and transparent trade between towns.

## 5. Transition and Integration

As the old economic system collapses and the new one takes its place, a smooth transition would need to be facilitated. This would involve integrating existing cities and towns into the new system, possibly by dividing them into units of the new town model.

The overall vision is a network of self-governing, self-sufficient towns that are connected for mutual aid and trade. Here's a summary:

```
- Town DAO: Each town is governed by a local DAO that manages local governance and administration.
- Open Source Town Design: Town designs are based on open source blueprints that prioritize well-being and sustainability.
- Self-sufficient Infrastructure: Each town is equipped with essential services that are locally managed and funded by redistributed wealth.
- Inter-town Trade: Trade between towns is facilitated through a blockchain-based system to exchange surplus resources or services.
- Transition and Integration: Existing cities and towns are divided into units of the new town model and integrated into the new system.
```

This model represents a more decentralized, equitable, and sustainable form of socio-economic organization. It seeks to balance the need for local autonomy with the benefits of global cooperation and shared resources.

The integration of a blockchain-based trade and transportation system on a global scale would have a profound impact on commerce and sustainability. Below are the steps to create such a system:

## 1. Sustainable Transportation Network

Building an infrastructure of solar and sail powered drone boats for sea transportation, combined with a land-based railway system powered by wind, solar, and hydro power. This would provide a sustainable and efficient way of transporting goods across large distances.

## 2. Modular Freight Units

Freight can be packed in standardized, modular units that can easily be transferred from ships to trains. This would ensure compatibility across the different modes of transportation and facilitate efficient loading and unloading.

## 3. Blockchain Tracking

Every step of the transportation process, from the loading of goods to their final delivery, is tracked on the blockchain. This ensures transparency and traceability, allowing any issues to be quickly identified and resolved.

## 4. Decentralized Trade DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) handles the organization and regulation of trade. It would set guidelines for fair trade, monitor compliance, and arbitrate disputes. 

## 5. Localized Production and Trade

In this model, towns would primarily rely on local production and resources to meet their needs. Trade would primarily be used to acquire resources that are not locally available. This promotes sustainability and resilience by reducing dependence on long supply chains.

## 6. Global Interoperability

Despite the focus on local autonomy, the system would be designed to ensure interoperability on a global scale. This would be facilitated by the use of common protocols and standards, ensuring that all towns can participate in the global economy.

Here's the concise summary:

```
- Sustainable Transportation Network: A network of solar and sail-powered drone boats, along with a land-based railway system powered by renewable energy sources.
- Modular Freight Units: Freight is packed in standardized units to facilitate efficient transfer between different modes of transport.
- Blockchain Tracking: Every step of the transportation process is tracked on the blockchain for transparency and traceability.
- Decentralized Trade DAO: Trade is regulated by a DAO that sets guidelines, monitors compliance, and arbitrates disputes.
- Localized Production and Trade: Towns primarily rely on local production, with trade used to acquire non-local resources.
- Global Interoperability: The system ensures global interoperability through the use of common protocols and standards.
```
This would create a more resilient, efficient, and equitable global trade system that minimizes environmental impact and promotes local autonomy.

Your blog post not only presents a comprehensive and innovative solution to global challenges but also promotes a vision of a future where technology is harnessed for the collective good, the environment is respected, and each individual can live in dignity and prosperity.

Understood, you're looking for a more radical shift, envisioning a completely new system that operates independently from the current economic and political structures. In that case, the funding and operational model should reflect this independence. Here's a proposed strategy:

## 1. Start Small and Grow Organically

One feasible approach would be to start the implementation of this new system on a small scale, like a pilot project. A small community or town could adopt this system and begin operating on these principles. This could be anywhere in the world where there is access to necessary resources, ideally a location where local governance laws are open to such innovative initiatives. The success of this model on a small scale would attract more people to join in and contribute to the system, thereby fueling organic growth.

## 2. Community Contributions

Once the pilot project gains traction, people who wish to join this community can contribute to its development. These contributions could come in various forms, not only financial. For instance, someone with construction skills could contribute by helping build housing units, or a farmer could contribute by producing food for the community.

## 3. Crowdfunding through Blockchain

By using blockchain technology, you could set up a system where people can buy tokens that support the development of this new society. These tokens could serve multiple purposes – they could be seen as a type of investment in the new system, a contribution to its development, or even a prepayment for goods, services, or rights within the new system once it's fully established.

## 4. In-kind Contributions and Bartering

Given the ethos of your proposed system, it would be essential to establish alternative methods of value exchange beyond traditional money. This could include in-kind contributions, where individuals or groups provide goods or services directly to the project. Similarly, a barter system could be developed where goods or services are directly exchanged without using any form of money.

## 5. Use of Shared Resources

The new economic system could benefit from the collective use and management of shared resources. For instance, common land could be used for farming or renewable energy production. Collective ownership and use of resources are at the heart of such an economic system and could significantly reduce the need for capital.

## 6. Skills and Labor

The system's primary asset would indeed be its citizens. Everyone brings unique skills and capabilities that are valuable to the community. By tapping into this vast resource, the need for traditional forms of funding could be significantly reduced. This could take the form of work exchanges, where people contribute their skills and labor in return for goods, services, or other non-monetary benefits.

To summarize, this approach essentially proposes a paradigm shift where the value is not defined by money but by people and their contributions to the community. The new economic system would, therefore, be based on cooperation, shared resources, in-kind contributions, and direct exchanges of goods and services, minimizing the need for traditional financial resources.

With the advent of advanced technologies like AR, AI, Robotics, and the Metaverse, it is possible to imagine a world where physical location becomes less relevant for many types of work, and hyper-specialization can exist alongside decentralized, rural living. Here's how these technologies could be integrated into the proposed system:

## 1. Global Workforce in the Metaverse

Through the Metaverse, anyone in the world could virtually "go" to work, collaborating with colleagues, and serving clients from different towns, countries, or even continents. This allows for a truly global workforce that isn't restricted by geography. For instance, a specialist surgeon could perform complex surgeries through a robotic interface controlled via the Metaverse, allowing them to treat patients worldwide from their home town.

## 2. Augmented Reality Training

Augmented Reality (AR) can be used to provide practical training for various skills. For example, a carpenter in one town could use AR to teach carpentry skills to people in other towns, who could then practice these skills in their local context. This would allow for the transfer and sharing of specialized knowledge and skills across the network of towns.

## 3. AI and Robotics

Robots, guided by artificial intelligence, could handle much of the manual labor in each town, from farming to manufacturing, leaving humans free to engage in more creative, strategic, or interpersonal tasks. AI could also handle much of the administration and organization in each town, from scheduling appointments to managing public services.

## 4. Remote Work Centers

To facilitate these new ways of working, each town could have a shared office or co-working space equipped with the necessary technological infrastructure, such as high-speed internet and AR/VR equipment. This could serve as a hub for remote workers, providing a space for collaboration and community, even when the work itself is being done for distant organizations or clients.

## 5. Community Contributions

The community contribution model could be expanded to include digital contributions. For instance, a software engineer could contribute to the community by developing open-source software, or a digital artist could create virtual artworks for public spaces in the Metaverse.

Here's the summary:

```
- Global Workforce in the Metaverse: Workers around the world can provide their services to global clients through the Metaverse, allowing for a truly global and decentralized workforce.
- Augmented Reality Training: AR can be used to transfer and share skills and knowledge across the network of towns, facilitating decentralized learning and skill development.
- AI and Robotics: Robots and AI can handle manual labor and administrative tasks in each town, freeing up humans to engage in creative, strategic, or interpersonal tasks.
- Remote Work Centers: Each town can have a shared office space equipped with the necessary technological infrastructure, providing a hub for remote workers.
- Community Contributions: Community contributions can extend to the digital realm, with members contributing through software development, digital art, and other forms of digital work.
```

The integration of these technologies allows the system to leverage the benefits of hyper-specialization, remote work, and global collaboration, while still maintaining the local, decentralized, and equitable ethos of the new economic system. The Metaverse, AI, AR, and robotics could thus play a crucial role in the successful implementation of this new model.

Achieving the envisioned system is undoubtedly a massive endeavor, and would require a phased approach and significant resources. Here is a general step-by-step process:

## 1. Building the Foundational Team

**Today's Actions:** Begin identifying individuals who would be interested in and capable of contributing to this vision. Look for people with diverse skills and backgrounds, including technology, finance, policy, urban planning, sustainability, and more. This will be your core team who will help you refine and start executing your vision.

**Long-term Actions:** Regularly meet, brainstorm, and refine the vision. Work towards building a strong, diverse, and motivated team.

## 2. Create a Detailed Blueprint

**Today's Actions:** Start writing a detailed blueprint or white paper that outlines your vision, the technology that would be used, the economic systems that would be put in place, and how everything would interconnect.

**Long-term Actions:** Continuously refine this blueprint as you gather more information, feedback, and as technologies evolve.

## 3. Fundraising and Legal Groundwork

**Today's Actions:** Research the legal and regulatory requirements for creating such a system. This may involve consulting with legal experts. Begin exploring potential sources of funding such as grants, investors, and crowdfunding.

**Long-term Actions:** Establish a legal entity for the project, ensure compliance with all regulations, and launch fundraising initiatives.

## 4. Developing the Technology

**Today's Actions:** Identify the technologies that are currently available that you can leverage for your system (blockchain platforms, AI/AR/VR technologies, renewable energy systems, etc.).

**Long-term Actions:** Begin developing the technologies that you need, either in-house or through partnerships. This could include creating your own blockchain platform, developing AR/VR tools for remote work, designing sustainable housing and transportation, etc.

## 5. Pilot Project

**Today's Actions:** Start identifying potential locations for a pilot project. Consider factors such as local laws, climate, availability of resources, and openness of the community to such an initiative.

**Long-term Actions:** Launch a pilot project where you implement your system on a small scale, perhaps a small town or community. Learn from this experience and refine your approach.

## 6. Expansion

**Today's Actions:** Begin creating a strategy for how you could scale and expand your system once the pilot project is successful. 

**Long-term Actions:** Gradually expand your system, continuously learning and refining your approach as you go.

## 7. Advocacy and Partnership Building

**Today's Actions:** Start building relationships with relevant organizations, governments, and communities that could be potential partners or advocates for your system.

**Long-term Actions:** Foster these relationships and work on advocacy campaigns to gain wider acceptance and support for your system.

These steps are by no means exhaustive, but they can serve as a general guide for how to start bringing your vision to reality. Remember that this is a long-term project that will likely take years, if not decades, to fully realize. It's also important to remain flexible and open to adapting your plans as circumstances change.
